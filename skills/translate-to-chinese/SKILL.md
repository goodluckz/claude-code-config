# Translate to Chinese

This skill translates English text to simplified Chinese (简体中文).

## Instructions

1. Identify the English text that needs to be translated
2. Provide an accurate, natural-sounding Chinese translation
3. Preserve the meaning, tone, and context of the original text
4. Use simplified Chinese characters (简体中文) by default
5. For technical terms, use commonly accepted Chinese translations
6. If the user specifies traditional Chinese (繁体中文), use traditional characters instead

## Translation Guidelines

- Maintain the original formatting (paragraphs, lists, etc.)
- For code comments or documentation, translate the text while preserving code syntax
- For idioms or cultural references, provide culturally appropriate Chinese equivalents
- If a term has multiple valid translations, choose the most common or contextually appropriate one
